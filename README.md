# 🎡 Welcome to the Fantastic Ferris Wheel Animation Project! 🎡

Prepare to be dazzled by the magic of a Ferris Wheel brought to life with nothing but **HTML** and **CSS**!

## 🎪 What's Inside The Big Top?

This project is a spectacle of two main acts:

1. 🎟️ `FerrisWheel.html`: Step right up and see the main attraction! This HTML file is the backbone of our Ferris Wheel, featuring a `.wheel` element with multiple `.line` and `.cabin` elements. It's the structure that keeps our wheel spinning!

2. 🎟️ `styles.css`: This is where the magic happens! Our CSS file is the ringmaster of this circus, dictating the styles for the `.wheel`, `.line`, and `.cabin` elements. It even controls the keyframes for the animation of the wheel and cabins. It's a spectacle you won't want to miss!

## 🎈 How To Join The Fun!

Want to see the Ferris Wheel in action? Just open the `FerrisWheel.html` file in your web browser and watch the magic unfold!

## 🎨 Be The Artist Of Your Own Circus!

Feel like adding your own flair to the Ferris Wheel? Go ahead and play around with the `styles.css` file. Change the color of the cabins, speed up or slow down the animation, or even resize the wheel. The sky's the limit!

So step right up, and let's bring the carnival to your computer! 🎪🎡🎠
